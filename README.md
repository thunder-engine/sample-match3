# Crystal Matcher - A Match-3 Game Project

A colorful and engaging **Match-3 puzzle game** built with **Thunde Engine** where players swap adjacent crystals to create matches of three or more identical gems.

## Features

*   **Intuitive Controls:** Click and swap adjacent crystals using mouse controls
*   **Match Detection:** Automatic detection of horizontal and vertical matches of 3 or more identical crystals
*   **Score System:** Earn points for every successful match with combo potential
*   **Visual Feedback:** Clear visual indicators for selected crystals and valid moves
*   **Chain Reactions:** Cascading matches when crystals fall and create new combinations

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Ensure you have the **Thunde Engine** installed and properly set up on your system
*   A C++ compiler with C++17 support or higher

## How to Play

1.  **Select a Crystal:** Click on any crystal to select it
2.  **Swap with Neighbor:** Click on an adjacent (up, down, left, right) crystal to swap positions
3.  **Create Matches:** Form lines of 3 or more identical crystals
4.  **Score Points:** Each match awards points - longer matches and combos yield higher scores
5.  **Watch for Cascades:** Matched crystals disappear, allowing new crystals to fall and potentially create chain reactions

## Controls

| Action | Control |
| :--- | :--- |
| Select Crystal | `Left Click` |
| Swap Crystals | `Left Click` on adjacent crystal |

## Game Rules

*   Only adjacent crystals can be swapped
*   Matches must contain at least 3 identical crystals
*   Matches can be horizontal or vertical
*   Swaps that don't create matches are automatically reverted
*   Score is calculated based on match length and combo multipliers

## Technology

This project is built as a learning exercise using the **Thunde Engine**, demonstrating 2D game development, grid-based logic, and puzzle game mechanics.
